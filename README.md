- 👋 Hi, I’m @UselessMC
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly coding minecraft plugins/mods
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop mods and more advanced java to help me with plugin development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much, I am more of a lone worker, I don't really want to work with people, although I am open to help and suggestions.
- 📫 How to reach me my main email  is krishavg@gmail.com, but my development stuff email which I check less often is itsuselessminecraft@gmail.com
